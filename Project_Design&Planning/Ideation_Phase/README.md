# IDEATION PHASE
    Ideation is the process where you generate ideas and solutions through sessions such as Sketching, Prototyping, Brainstorming, Brainwriting, Worst Possible Idea, and a wealth of other ideation techniques. Ideation is also the third stage in the Design Thinking process.

## BRAINSTORM & IDEATION :
    To try to solve a problem or come up with new ideas by having a discussion that includes all members of a group : to discuss a problem or issue and suggest solutions and ideas

## LITERATURE SURVEY :
    A literature review is a comprehensive summary of previous research on a topic. The literature review surveys scholarly articles, books, and other sources relevant to a particular area of research.

## EMPATHY MAP CANVAS :
    An empathy map is a visual tool used to gain insight into a user's perspective. Using one allows you to tap into a user's mind and gain their unique perspective. Empathy maps are great in all scenarios where you have to consider user feelings.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT :
    A problem statement is a concise description of an issue to be addressed or a condition to be improved upon. It identifies the gap between the current (problem) state and desired (goal) state of a process or product. Focusing on the facts, the problem statement should be designed
